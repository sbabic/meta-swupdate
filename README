meta-swupdate, Yocto layer for deploy tool
==========================================

This layer's purpose is to add support for a deployment
mechanism of Yocto's images based on swupdate project.

Layer dependencies
------------------

This layer depends on:

URI: git://github.com/openembedded/meta-openembedded.git
subdirectory: meta-oe

BitBake variable expansion
--------------------------

To insert the values of BitBake variables into the update file, pre- and postfix
the names with "@@". For example, to automatically set the version tag, use the
line `version = "@@DISTRO_VERSION@@";` in your sw-description file.

Image hashing
-------------

During creation of the update file, occurrences of @IMAGE (where IMAGE is an
image filename) are replaced with the sha256 hash of the image.

BitBake auto versions
---------------------

By setting the version tag in the update file to `@SWU_AUTO_VERSION` it is
automatically replaced with `PV` from BitBake's package-data-file for the package
matching the name of the provided filename tag.

Since the filename can differ from package name (deployed with another name or
the file is a container for the real package) you can append the correct package
name to the tag:
`@SWU_AUTO_VERSION:<package-name>`

To insert the value of a variable from BitBake's package-data-file different to
`PV` (e.g. `PKGV`) you can append the variable name to the tag:
`@SWU_AUTO_VERSION@<package-data-variable>`
or
`@SWU_AUTO_VERSION:<package-name>@<package-data-variable>`

SWU image signing
-----------------

There are 3 signing mechanisms supported by meta-swupdate at the moment:

1. RSA signing:

  * Set variable: `SWUPDATE_SIGNING = "RSA"`

  * Set `SWUPDATE_PRIVATE_KEY` to the full path of private key file

2. CMS signing:

  * Set variable: `SWUPDATE_SIGNING = "CMS"`

  * Set `SWUPDATE_CMS_CERT` to the full path of certificate file

  * Set `SWUPDATE_CMS_KEY ` to the full path of private key file

3. Custom signing tool:

  * Set variable: `SWUPDATE_SIGNING = "CUSTOM"`

  * Set variable `SWUPDATE_SIGN_TOOL' to custom string that needs to be
    executed in order to perform the signing

sw-description is signed and the signature is written to sw-description.sig
which is included in the SWU file.

Encrypted private keys are not currently supported since a secure
mechanism must exist to provide the passphrase.
